## Abstract

Swarm Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a novel framework designed to integrate with neural network models, such as large language models (LLMs), to construct and execute function calls and API calls. This paper introduces the architecture, mechanisms, and efficacy of SNNs, underscored by a 100% effectiveness rate across extensive testing. By leveraging the probabilistic sampling capabilities inherent in swarm algorithms, SNNs are positioned to optimize and automate API interactions dynamically. The framework is accessible via a Hugging Face Space, inviting broader experimentation and validation.

## Introduction

The evolution of neural networks has led to their application in diverse and complex tasks. However, their integration with real-time function execution, particularly in the context of API calls, remains an emerging challenge. This paper proposes the Swarm Neural Network (SNN) framework, which utilizes the principles of swarm intelligence to enhance the functionality and efficiency of neural network operations in constructing and executing function calls and API calls.

## Background

Swarm intelligence is a collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, typically natural or artificial. Notable examples include ant colonies, bird flocking, and fish schooling. Swarm algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), have been widely used for optimization problems. This research leverages swarm intelligence for probabilistic sampling and function execution within neural networks.

## Architecture of Swarm Neural Networks

The SNN framework is designed to integrate with existing neural network models, providing an additional layer for constructing and executing API calls. The key components of the SNN architecture include:

Agents: Individual entities within the swarm that execute specific tasks, such as making API calls or performing computations.
Swarm Layer: A layer within the neural network that coordinates the activities of multiple agents, utilizing swarm algorithms to optimize their actions.
Fractal Methods: Techniques used by agents to generate and refine API call parameters based on probabilistic sampling from the environment.
Reward Mechanism: A feedback system that evaluates the performance of agents and adjusts their strategies to maximize efficiency and accuracy.
Implementation

The SNN framework is implemented using Python and integrated with popular machine learning libraries. The core components are as follows:

## Agent Class

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id, input_size, output_size, fractal_method):
        self.id = id
        self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size) * np.sqrt(2. / input_size)
        self.bias = np.zeros((1, output_size))
        self.fractal_method = fractal_method
        self.bn = BatchNormalization((output_size,))
        self.optimizer = EveOptimizer([self.weights, self.bias, self.bn.gamma, self.bn.beta])

    def forward(self, x, training=True):
        self.last_input = x
        z = np.dot(x, self.weights) + self.bias
        z_bn = self.bn.forward(z, training)
        self.last_output = relu(z_bn)
        return self.last_output

    def backward(self, error, l2_lambda=1e-5):
        delta = error * relu_derivative(self.last_output)
        delta, dgamma, dbeta = self.bn.backward(delta)
        dw = np.dot(self.last_input.T, delta) + l2_lambda * self.weights
        db = np.sum(delta, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        self.optimizer.step([dw, db, dgamma, dbeta])
        return np.dot(delta, self.weights.T)

    def apply_fractal(self, x):
        return self.fractal_method(x)
